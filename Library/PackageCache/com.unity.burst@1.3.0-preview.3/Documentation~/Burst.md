# **_Burst User Guide_**

Burst is a compiler that translates from IL/.NET bytecode to highly optimized native code using LLVM. It is released as a Unity package and integrated into Unity using the Unity Package Manager.

# Quick Start

## Compile a Job with the Burst compiler

Burst is primarily designed to work efficiently with the Job system. 

You can start using the Burst compiler in your code by simply decorating a Job struct with the attribute `[BurstCompile]`

```c#
using Unity.Burst;
using Unity.Collections;
using Unity.Jobs;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyBurst2Behavior : MonoBehaviour
{
    void Start()
    {
        var input = new NativeArray<float>(10, Allocator.Persistent);
        var output = new NativeArray<float>(1, Allocator.Persistent);
        for (int i = 0; i < input.Length; i++)
            input[i] = 1.0f * i;

        var job = new MyJob
        {
            Input = input,
            Output = output
        };
        job.Schedule().Complete();

        Debug.Log("The result of the sum is: " + output[0]);
        input.Dispose();
        output.Dispose();
    }

    // Using BurstCompile to compile a Job with Burst
    // Set CompileSynchronously to true to make sure that the method will not be compiled asynchronously
    // but on the first schedule
    [BurstCompile(CompileSynchronously = true)]
    private struct MyJob : IJob
    {
        [ReadOnly]
        public NativeArray<float> Input;

        [WriteOnly]
        public NativeArray<float> Output;

        public void Execute()
        {
            float result = 0.0f;
            for (int i = 0; i < Input.Length; i++)
            {
                result += Input[i];
            }
            Output[0] = result;
        }
    }
}
```

By default (only within the Editor - See [AOT vs JIT](#just-in-time-jit-vs-ahead-of-time-aot-compilation)), Burst JIT compiles jobs asynchronously, but  the example above uses the option `CompileSynchronously = true` to make sure that the method is compiled on the first schedule. In general, you should use asynchronous compilation. See [`[BurstCompile]` options](#synchronous-compilation)

<a name="jobs-burst-menu"></a>
## Jobs/Burst Menu

The Burst package adds a few menu entries to the Jobs menu for controlling Burst behavior:

![Burst menu entries](images/burst-menu.png)

- **Enable Compilation**: When checked, Burst compiles Jobs and Burst custom delegates that are tagged with the attribute `[BurstCompile]`. Default is checked.
- **Enable Safety Checks**: When checked, Burst enables safety checks on code that uses collection containers (e.g `NativeArray<T>`). Checks include job data dependency and container indexes out of bounds. Note that this option disables the noaliasing performance optimizations, by default. Default is checked.
- **Synchronous Compilation**: When checked, Burst will compile synchronously - See [`[BurstCompile]` options](#synchronous-compilation). Default is unchecked.
- **Show Timings**: When checked, Burst logs the time it takes to JIT compile a Job in the Editor. Default is unchecked.
- **Open Inspector...**: Opens the [Burst Inspector Window](#burst-inspector).

## Burst Inspector

The Burst Inspector window displays all the Jobs and other Burst compile targets in the project. Open the Inspector from the Jobs menu (**Jobs** > **Burst Inspector**).

The inspector allows you to view all the Jobs that can be compiled, you can also then check the generated intermediate and native assembly code.

![Burst Inspector](images/burst-inspector.png)

On the left pane of the window, **Compile Targets** provides an alphabetically sorted list of the Jobs in the project that Burst can compile. Note that the disabled Jobs in the list don't have the `[BurstCompile]` attribute.

On the right pane, the window displays options for viewing the assembly and intermediate code for the selected compile target.

**To view the disassembly for a Job:**

1. Select an active compile target from the _left pane_.
3. Switch between the different tabs to display the details:
   * **Assembly** provides the final optimized native code generated by Burst
   * **.NET IL** provides a view on the original .NET IL extracted from the Job method
   * **LLVM IR (Unoptimized)** provides a view on the internal LLVM IR before optimizations.
   * **LLVM IR (Optimized)** provides a view on the internal LLVM IR after optimizations.
   * **LLVM IR Optimization Diagnostics** provides detailed LLVM diagnostics of the optimizations (i.e if they succeeded or failed).
4. You can also turn on different options:
   * The **Enhanced Disassembly** option colorizes the **Assembly** View and inserts the source C# statements, correlating the assembly code with the source file, line and statement.
   * The **Safety Checks** option generates code that includes container access safety checks (e.g check if a job is writing to a native container that is readonly).

> NOTE: While the inspector can disassemble for `AVX`, `AVX2`, `AVX512` CPU architectures, these architectures are currently not supported by Burst at runtime. They will fallback to `SSE4`

## Command-line Options

You can pass the following options to the Unity Editor on the command line to control Burst:

- `-burst-disable-compilation` — turns Burst off.
- `-burst-force-sync-compilation` — Burst always compiles synchronously. See [`[BurstCompile]` options](#synchronous-compilation).

# Just-In-Time (JIT) vs Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) Compilation

When working on your projects in the editor (play mode), burst works in a Just-In-Time (JIT) fashion. Burst will compile your code at the point that it is to be used. By default this is done asnychronously which means your code will be running under the default mono JIT until the compilation by burst has been completed.
You can control this behaviour via [`[BurstCompile]` options](#synchronous-compilation).

However when you build your project into a Standalone Player, burst will instead compile all the supported code Ahead-Of-Time (AOT). AOT compilation at present, requires access to some linker tools for the respective platforms (similar to the requirements of IL2CPP). See [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements).

See [Standalone Player Support](#standalone-player-support).

# C#/.NET Language Support

Burst is working on a subset of .NET that doesn't allow the usage of any managed objects/reference types in your code (class in C#).

The following sections gives more details about the constructs actually supported by Burst.

## Supported .NET types

### Primitive types

Burst supports the following primitive types:

- `bool`
- `sbyte`/`byte`
- `short`/`ushort`
- `int`/`uint`
- `long`/`ulong`
- `float`
- `double`

Burst does not support the following types:

- `char` (this will be supported in a future release)
- `string` as this is a managed type
- `decimal`

### Vector types

Burst is able to translate vector types from `Unity.Mathematics` to native SIMD vector types with first class support for optimizations:

- `bool2`/`bool3`/`bool4`
- `uint2`/`uint3`/`uint4`
- `int2`/`int3`/`int4`
- `float2`/`float3`/`float4`

> Note that for performance reasons, the 4 wide types (`float4`, `int4`...) should be preferred

### Enum types

Burst supports all enums including enums with a specific storage type (e.g `public enum MyEnum : short`)

> Burst doesn't currently support `Enum` methods (e.g `Enum.HasFlag`)

### Struct types

Burst supports regular structs with any field with supported types.

Burst supports fixed array fields.

Regarding the layout, `LayoutKind.Sequential` and `LayoutKind.Explicit` are both supported

> The `StructLayout.Pack` packing size is not supported

The `System.IntPtr` and `UIntPtr` are supported natively as an intrinsic struct directly representing pointers.

### Pointer types

Burst supports any pointer types to any Burst supported types

### Generic types

Burst supports generic types used with structs. 
Specifically, it supports full instantiation of generic calls for generic types with interface constraints (e.g when a struct with a generic parameter requiring to implement an interface)

### Array types

Managed arrays are not supported by Burst. You should use instead a native container, `NativeArray<T>` for instance.

Burst supports reading from readonly managed arrays loaded only from static readonly fields:

```c#
[BurstCompile]
public struct MyJob : IJob {
    private static readonly int[] _preComputeTable = new int[] {1,2,3,4};

    public int Index {get; set;}

    public void Execute()
    {
        int x = _preComputeTable[0];
        int z = _preComputeTable[Index];
    }
}
```

Accessing a static readonly managed array has with the following restrictions:

- It is not allowed to pass this static managed array around (e.g method argument), you have to use it directly
- Elements of a readonly static managed arrays should not be modified by a C# code external to jobs, as the Burst compiler is making a readonly copy of the data at compilation time
- Array of structs are also supported at the condition that the struct constructor doesn't have any control flow (e.g `if`/`else`) or is throwing an exception

## Language Support

Burst supports most of the expressions and statements:

- Regular C# control flows:
  - `if`/`else`/`switch`/`case`/`for`/`while`/`break`/`continue`
- Extension methods
- Unsafe code, pointers manipulation...etc.
- Instance methods of structs
- By ref/out parameters
- DllImport and internal calls
- Limited support for `throw` expressions, assuming simple throw patterns (e.g `throw new ArgumentException("Invalid argument")`). In that case, we will try to extract the static string exception message to include it in the generated code.
- Some special IL opcodes like `cpblk`, `initblk`, `sizeof`
- Loading from static readonly fields

Burst provides also alternatives for some C# constructions not directly accessible to HPC#:

- [Function pointers](#function-pointers) as an alternative to using delegates within HPC#
- [Shared Static](#shared-static) to access static mutable data from both C# and HPC#

Burst does not support:

- `catch`
- `try`/`finally` (which will come at some point)
- `foreach` as it is requiring `try`/`finally` (This should be supported in a future version)
- Storing to static fields except via [Shared Static](#shared-static)
- Any methods related to managed objects (e.g string methods...etc.)

### Intrinsics

#### `System.Math`

Burst provides an intrinsic for all methods declared by `System.Math` except for the following methods that are not supported:
 - `double IEEERemainder(double x, double y)` 
 - `Round(double value, int digits)`

#### `System.IntPtr`

Burst supports all methods of `System.IntPtr`/`System.UIntPtr`, including the static fields `IntPtr.Zero` and `IntPtr.Size`

#### `System.Threading.Interlocked`

Burst supports atomic memory intrinsics for all methods provided by `System.Threading.Interlocked` (e.g `Interlocked.Increment`...etc.)

Care must be taken when using the interlocked methods that the source location being atomically accessed is _naturally aligned_ - EG. the alignment of the pointer is a multiple of the pointed-to-type.

For example:

```c#
[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)]
struct Foo
{
    [FieldOffset(0)] public long a;
    [FieldOffset(5)] public long b;

    public long AtomicReadAndAdd()
    {
        return Interlocked.Read(ref a) + Interlocked.Read(ref b);
    }
}
```

And lets assume that the pointer to the struct `Foo` has an alignment of 8 - the natural alignment of a `long` value. The `Interlocked.Read` of `a` would be successful because it lies on a _naturally aligned_ address, but `b` would not. Undefined behaviour will occur at the load of `b` as a result.

### Unity.Burst.Intrinsics

Burst provides low level close-to-the-metal intrinsics via th `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics` namespace.

#### Common

The `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common` intrinsics are for functionality that is shared across the hardware targets that Burst supports.

##### Pause

The `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.Pause` is an **experimental** intrinsic that provides a hint that the current thread should pause. It maps to `pause` on x86, and `yield` on ARM.

It is used primarily to stop spin locks over contending on an atomic access, to reduce contention and power on that section of code.

The intrinsic is **experimental** and so guarded by the `UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_PAUSE_INTRINSIC` preprocessor define.

##### umul128

The `Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.umul128` is an intrinsic that enables users to access 128-bit unsigned multiplication. These multiplies have become increasingly prevalent in hashing functions. It maps 1:1 with hardware instructions on x86 and ARM targets.

# Debugging

> NOTE: Burst does not provide currently a dedicated debugger for Burst compiled Jobs. 
>
> If you need to debug a job, you will need to disable the Burst compiler or comment the `[BurstCompile]` attribute from your job and attach a **regular .NET managed debugger**

# Advanced usages

## BurstDiscard attribute

When running some code in the full C# (not inside a Burst compiled code), you may want to use some managed objects but you would like to not compile these portion of code when compiling within Burst.

To mitigate this, you can use the `[BurstDiscard]` attribute on a method:

```c#
[BurstCompile]
public struct MyJob : IJob
{
    public void Execute()
    {
        // Only executed when running from a full .NET runtime
        // this method call will be discard when compiling this job with
        // [BurstCompile] attribute
        MethodToDiscard();
    }

    [BurstDiscard]
    private static void MethodToDiscard(int arg)
    {
        Debug.Log($"This is a test: {arg}");
    }
}
```

> A method with `[BurstDiscard]` cannot have a return value or an `ref/out` parameter

## Synchronous Compilation

By default, the Burst compiler in the editor will compile the jobs asynchronously.

You can change this behavior by setting `CompileSynchronously = true` for the `[BurstCompile]` attribute:

```c#
[BurstCompile(CompileSynchronously = true)]
public struct MyJob : IJob
{
    // ...
}
```

When running a Burst job in the editor, the first attempt to call the job will cause the asynchronous compilation of the Burst job to be kicked off in the background, while running the managed C# job in the mean time. This minimizes any frame hitching and keeps the experience for you and your users responsive.

When `CompileSynchronously = true` is set, no asynchronous compilation can occur. Burst is focused on providing highly performance oriented code-generation and as a result will take a little longer than a traditional JIT to compile. Crucially this pause for compilation _will affect the current running frame_, meaning that hitches can occur and it could provide an unresponsive experience for users. In general the only legitimate uses of `CompileSynchronously = true` are:

- If you have a long running job that will only run once, the performance of the compiled code could out-weigh the cost of doing the compilation.
- If you are profiling a Burst job and thus want to be certain that the code that is being tested is from the Burst compiler. In this scenario you should perform a warmup to throw away any timing measurements from the first call to the job as that would include the compilation cost and skew the result.
- If you suspect that there are some crucial differences between managed and Burst compiled code. This is really only as a debugging aid, as the Burst compiler strives to match any and all behaviour that managed code could produce.

## Function pointers

It is often required to work with dynamic functions that can process data based on other data states. In that case, a user would expect to use C# delegates but in Burst, because these delegates are managed objects, we need to provide a HPC# compatible alternative. In that case you can use `FunctionPointer<T>`.

First you need identify the static functions that will be compiled with Burst:
- add a `[BurstCompile]` attribute to these functions
- add a `[BurstCompile]` attribute to the containing type. This attribute is only here to help the Burst compiler to look for static methods with `[BurstCompile]` attribute
- create the "interface" of these functions by declaring a delegate:

```c#
// Instruct Burst to look for static methods with [BurstCompile] attribute
[BurstCompile]
class EnclosingType {
    [BurstCompile]
    public static float MultiplyFloat(float a, float b) => a * b;

    [BurstCompile]
    public static float AddFloat(float a, float b) => a + b;

    // A common interface for both MultiplyFloat and AddFloat methods
    public delegate float Process2FloatsDelegate(float a, float b);
}
```

Then you need to compile these function pointers from regular C# code:

```c#
    // Contains a compiled version of MultiplyFloat with burst
    FunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate> mulFunctionPointer = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(MultiplyFloat);

    // Contains a compiled version of AddFloat with burst
    FunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate> addFunctionPointer = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(AddFloat);
```

Lastly, you can use these function pointers directly from a Job by passing them to the Job struct directly:

```c#
    // Invoke the function pointers from HPC# jobs
    var resultMul = mulFunctionPointer.Invoke(1.0f, 2.0f);
    var resultAdd = addFunctionPointer.Invoke(1.0f, 2.0f);
``` 

Note that you can also use these function pointers from regular C# as well, but it is highly recommended (for performance reasons) to cache the `FunctionPointer<T>.Invoke` property (which is the delegate instance) to a static field.

```c#
    private readonly static Process2FloatsDelegate mulFunctionPointerInvoke = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(MultiplyFloat).Invoke;

    // Invoke the delegate from C#
    var resultMul = mulFunctionPointerInvoke(1.0f, 2.0f);
```

> A few important additional notes:
>
> - Function pointers are compiled asynchronously by default as for jobs. You can still force a synchronous compilation of function pointers by specifying this via the `[BurstCompile(SynchronousCompilation = true)]`.
> - Function pointers have limited support for exceptions. As is the case for jobs, exceptions only work in the editor (`2019.3+` only) and they will result in a crash if they are used within a standalone player. It is recommended not to rely on any logic related to exception handling when working with function pointers.
> - Using Burst-compiled function pointers from C# could be slower than their pure C# version counterparts if the function is too small compared to the cost of P/Invoke interop.
> - A function pointer compiled with Burst cannot be called directly from another function pointer. This limitation will be lifted in a future release. You can workaround this limitation by creating a wrapper function with the `[BurstCompile]` attribute and to use the shared function from there.
> - Function pointers don't support generic delegates.

## Shared Static

Burst has basic support for accessing static readonly data, but if you want to share static mutable data between C# and HPC#, you need to use the `SharedStatic<T>` struct.

Let's take the example of accessing an `int` static field that could be changed by both C# and HPC#:

```C#
    public abstract class MutableStaticTest
    {
        public static readonly SharedStatic<int> IntField = SharedStatic<int>.GetOrCreate<MutableStaticTest, IntFieldKey>();

        // Define a Key type to identify IntField
        private class IntFieldKey {}
    }
```     

that can then be accessed from C# and HPC#:

```C#
    // Write to a shared static 
    MutableStaticTest.IntField.Data = 5;
    // Read from a shared static
    var value = 1 + MutableStaticTest.IntField.Data;
``` 

> A few important additional notes:
>
> - The type of the data is defined by the `T` in `SharedStatic<T>`.
> - In order to identify a static field, you need to provide a context for it: the common way to solve this is to create a key for both the containing type (e.g `MutableStaticTest` in our example above) and to identify the field (e.g `IntFieldKey` class in our example) and by passing these classes as generic arguments of `SharedStatic<int>.GetOrCreate<MutableStaticTest, IntFieldKey>()`.
> - It is recommended to always initialize the shared static field in C# from a static constructor before accessing it from HPC#. Not initializing the data before accessing it can lead to an undefined initialization state.

## Dynamic dispatch based on runtime CPU features 

For all `x86`/`x64` CPU desktop platforms, Burst will dispatch jobs to different version compiled by taking into account CPU features available at runtime. 

Currently for for `x86` and `x64` CPU, Burst is supporting at runtime only `SSE2` and `SSE4` instruction sets. 

For example, with dynamic CPU dispatch, if your CPU is supports `SSE3` and below, Burst will select `SSE2` automatically.

See the table in the section [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements) for more details about the supported CPU architectures.

# Optimization Guidelines

## Memory Aliasing and `noalias` 

Memory aliasing is an important concept that can lead to significant optimizations for a compiler that is aware about how data is being used by the code.

### The problem

Let's take a simple example of a job copying data from an input array to an output array:


```c#
[BurstCompile]
private struct CopyJob : IJob
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> Input;

    [WriteOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> Output;

    public void Execute()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < Input.Length; i++)
        {
            Output[i] = Input[i];
        }
    }
}
```
#### No memory aliasing:

If the two arrays `Input` and `Output` are not slightly overlapping, meaning that their respective memory location are **not aliasing**, we will get the following result after running this job on a sample input/output:

![Memory with no aliasing](images/burst-noalias.png)

#### No memory aliasing with the auto-vectorizer:

Now, if the compiler is **noalias aware**, it will be able to optimize the previous scalar loop (working at a scalar level) by what is called **vectorizing**: The compiler will rewrite the loop on your behalf to process elements by a small batch (working at a vector level, 4 by 4 elements for example) like this:

![Code with memory with no aliasing vectorized](images/burst-noalias-vectorized.png)

#### Memory aliasing:

Next, if for some reasons (that is not directly easy to introduce with the JobSystem today), the Output array is actually overlapping the Input array by one element off (e.g `Output[0]` points actually to `Input[1]`) meaning that memory are **aliasing**, we will get the following result when running the `CopyJob` (assuming that the auto-vectorizer is not running):

![Memory with aliasing](images/burst-alias.png)

#### Memory aliasing with invalid vectorized code:

Worse, if the compiler was not aware of this memory aliasing, it would still try to auto-vectorize the loop, and we would get the following result, which is different from the previous scalar version:

![Memory with aliasing with invalid vectorized code](images/burst-alias-vectorized.png)

The result of this code would be invalid and could lead to very serious bugs if they are not identified by the compiler.

#### Example of Generated Code

Let's take the example of the `x64` assembly targeted at `AVX2` for the loop in the `CopyJob` above:

```
.LBB0_4:
    vmovups ymm0, ymmword ptr [rcx - 96]
    vmovups ymm1, ymmword ptr [rcx - 64]
    vmovups ymm2, ymmword ptr [rcx - 32]
    vmovups ymm3, ymmword ptr [rcx]
    vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 96], ymm0
    vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 64], ymm1
    vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 32], ymm2
    vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx], ymm3
    sub     rdx, -128
    sub     rcx, -128
    add     rsi, -32
    jne     .LBB0_4
    test    r10d, r10d
    je      .LBB0_8
```
As can be seen, the instruction `vmovups` is moving 8 floats here, so a single auto-vectorized loop is now moving 4 x 8 = **32 floats copied per loop iteration** instead of just one!

If we compile the same loop but artificially disable Burst's knowledge of aliasing, we get the following code:

```
.LBB0_2:
    mov     r8, qword ptr [rcx]
    mov     rdx, qword ptr [rcx + 16]
    cdqe
    mov     edx, dword ptr [rdx + 4*rax]
    mov     dword ptr [r8 + 4*rax], edx
    inc     eax
    cmp     eax, dword ptr [rcx + 8]
    jl      .LBB0_2
```

Which is entirely scalar, and will run roughly 32 times slower than the highly optimized vectorized variant that our alias analysis can produce.

### Burst and the JobSystem

Unity's job-system infrastructure imposes certain rules on what can alias within a job struct:

- Structs attributed with `[NativeContainer]`, for example `NativeArray` and `NativeSlice`, that are members of a job struct **do not alias**.
- But job struct members with the `[NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestriction]` attribute, these **can alias** with other members (because you as the user have explicitly opted in to this aliasing).
- Pointers to structs attributed with `[NativeContainer]` cannot appear within other structs attributed with `[NativeContainer]`. For example you cannot have a `NativeArray<NativeSlice<T>>`. This kind of spaghetti code is awful for optimizing compilers to understand.

Let us now look at an example job:

```c#
[BurstCompile]
private struct MyJob : IJob
{
    public NativeArray<float> a;
    public NativeArray<float> b;
    public NativeSlice<int> c;

    [NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestriction]
    public NativeArray<byte> d;

    public void Execute() { ... }
}
```

In the above example:

- `a`, `b`, and `c` do not alias with each other.
- But `d` **can alias** with `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Those of you used to C/C++'s [Type Based Alias Analysis (TBAA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alias_analysis#Type-based_alias_analysis) might think _'But `d` has a different type from `a`, `b`, or `c`, so it should not alias!'_ - pointers in C\# do not have any assumption that pointing to a different type results in no aliasing though. So `d` must be assumed to alias with `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### The NoAlias Attribute

Burst has a `[NoAlias]` attribute that can be used to give the compiler additional information on the aliasing of pointers and structs. There are four uses of this attribute:

- On a function parameter it signifies that the parameter does not alias with any other parameter to the function.
- On a struct field it signifies that the field does not alias with any other field of the struct.
- On a struct itself it signifies that the address of the struct cannot appear within the struct itself.
- On a function return value it signifies that the returned pointer does not alias with any other pointer returned from the same function.

These attributes do not need to be used when dealing with `[NativeContainer]` attributed structs, or with fields in job structs - the Burst compiler is smart enough to infer the no-alias information about these without manual intervention from you, our users. This leads onto a general rule of thumb - the use of the `[NoAlias]` attribute is generally not required for user code, and we advise against its use. The attribute is exposed primarily for those constructing complex data structures where the aliasing cannot be inferred by the compiler. Any use of `[NoAlias]` on a pointer that could alias with another could result in undefined behaviour and hard to track down bugs.

#### NoAlias Function Parameter

Lets take a look at the following classic aliasing example:

```c#
int Foo(ref int a, ref int b)
{
    b = 13;
    a = 42;
    return b;
}
```

For this the compiler produces the following assembly:

```
mov     dword ptr [rdx], 13
mov     dword ptr [rcx], 42
mov     eax, dword ptr [rdx]
ret
```

As can be seen it:

- Stores 13 into `b`.
- Stores 42 into `a`.
- Reloads the value from `b` to return it.

It has to reload `b` because the compiler _does not know_ whether `a` and `b` are backed by the same memory or not.

Let's now add a `[NoAlias]` attribute and see what we get:

```c#
int Foo([NoAlias] ref int a, ref int b)
{
    b = 13;
    a = 42;
    return b;
}
```

Which turns into:

```
mov     dword ptr [rdx], 13
mov     dword ptr [rcx], 42
mov     eax, 13
ret
```

Notice that the load from `b` has been replaced with moving the constant 13 into the return register.

#### NoAlias Struct Field

Let's take the same example from above but apply it to a struct instead:

```c#
struct Bar
{
    public NativeArray<int> a;
    public NativeArray<float> b;
}

int Foo(ref Bar bar)
{
    bar.b[0] = 42.0f;
    bar.a[0] = 13;
    return (int)bar.b[0];
}
```

The above produces the following assembly:

```
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx + 16]
mov     dword ptr [rax], 1109917696
mov     rcx, qword ptr [rcx]
mov     dword ptr [rcx], 13
cvttss2si       eax, dword ptr [rax]
ret
```

As can be seen it:

- Loads the address of the data in `b` into `rax`.
- Stores 42 into it (1109917696 is 0x‭42280000‬ which is 42.0f).
- Loads the address of the data in `a` into `rcx`.
- Stores 13 into it.
- Reloads the data in `b` and converts it to an integer for returning.

Let's assume that you as the user know that the two NativeArray's are not backed by the same memory, you could:

```c#
struct Bar
{
    [NoAlias]
    public NativeArray<int> a;

    [NoAlias]
    public NativeArray<float> b;
}

int Foo(ref Bar bar)
{
    bar.b[0] = 42.0f;
    bar.a[0] = 13;
    return (int)bar.b[0];
}
```

By attributing both `a` and `b` with `[NoAlias]` we have told the compiler that they definitely do not alias with each other within the struct, which produces the following assembly:

```
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx + 16]
mov     dword ptr [rax], 1109917696
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx]
mov     dword ptr [rax], 13
mov     eax, 42
ret
```

Notice that the compiler can now just return the integer constant 42!

#### NoAlias Struct

Nearly all structs you will create as a user will be able to have the assumption that the pointer to the struct does not appear within the struct itself. Let's take a look at a classic example where this **is not** true:

```c#
unsafe struct CircularList
{
    public CircularList* next;

    public CircularList()
    {
        // The 'empty' list just points to itself.
        next = this;
    }
}
```

Lists are one of the few structures where it is normal to have the pointer to the struct accessible from somewhere within the struct itself.

Now onto a more concrete example of where `[NoAlias]` on a struct can help:

```c#
unsafe struct Bar
{
    public int i;
    public void* p;
}

float Foo(ref Bar bar)
{
    *(int*)bar.p = 42;
    return ((float*)bar.p)[bar.i];
}
```

Which produces the following assembly:

```
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8]
mov     dword ptr [rax], 42
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8]
mov     ecx, dword ptr [rcx]
movss   xmm0, dword ptr [rax + 4*rcx]
ret
```

As can be seen it:
- Loads `p` into `rax`.
- Stores 42 into `p`.
- Loads `p` into `rax` again.
- Loads `i` into `ecx`.
- Returns the index into `p` by `i`.

Notice that it loaded `p` twice - why? The reason is that the compiler does not know whether `p` points to the address of the struct `bar` itself - so once it has stored 42 into `p`, it has to reload the address of `p` from bar, just incase. A wasted load!

Lets add `[NoAlias]` now:

```c#
[NoAlias]
unsafe struct Bar
{
    public int i;
    public void* p;
}

float Foo(ref Bar bar)
{
    *(int*)bar.p = 42;
    return ((float*)bar.p)[bar.i];
}
```

Which produces the following assembly:

```
mov     rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8]
mov     dword ptr [rax], 42
mov     ecx, dword ptr [rcx]
movss   xmm0, dword ptr [rax + 4*rcx]
ret
```

Notice that it only loaded the address of `p` once, because we've told the compiler that `p` cannot be the pointer to `bar`!

#### NoAlias Function Return

Some functions can only return a unique pointer. For instance, `malloc` will only ever give you a unique pointer. For these cases `[return:NoAlias]` can provide the compiler with some useful information.

Lets take an example using a bump allocator backed with a stack allocation:

```c#
// Only ever returns a unique address into the stackalloc'ed memory.
// We've made this no-inline as the compiler will always try and inline
// small functions like these, which would defeat the purpose of this
// example!
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
unsafe int* BumpAlloc(int* alloca)
{
    int location = alloca[0]++;
    return alloca + location;
}

unsafe int Func()
{
    int* alloca = stackalloc int[128];

    // Store our size at the start of the alloca.
    alloca[0] = 1;

    int* ptr1 = BumpAlloc(alloca);
    int* ptr2 = BumpAlloc(alloca);

    *ptr1 = 42;
    *ptr2 = 13;

    return *ptr1;
}
```

Which produces the following assembly:

```
push    rsi
push    rdi
push    rbx
sub     rsp, 544
lea     rcx, [rsp + 36]
movabs  rax, offset memset
mov     r8d, 508
xor     edx, edx
call    rax
mov     dword ptr [rsp + 32], 1
movabs  rbx, offset "BumpAlloc(int* alloca)"
lea     rsi, [rsp + 32]
mov     rcx, rsi
call    rbx
mov     rdi, rax
mov     rcx, rsi
call    rbx
mov     dword ptr [rdi], 42
mov     dword ptr [rax], 13
mov     eax, dword ptr [rdi]
add     rsp, 544
pop     rbx
pop     rdi
pop     rsi
ret
```

It's quite a lot of assembly, but the key bit is that it:

- Has `ptr1` in `rdi`.
- Has `ptr2` in `rax`.
- Stores 42 into `ptr1`.
- Stores 13 into `ptr2`.
- Loads `ptr1` again to return it.

Let's now add our `[return: NoAlias]` attribute:

```c#
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
[return: NoAlias]
unsafe int* BumpAlloc(int* alloca)
{
    int location = alloca[0]++;
    return alloca + location;
}

unsafe int Func()
{
    int* alloca = stackalloc int[128];

    // Store our size at the start of the alloca.
    alloca[0] = 1;

    int* ptr1 = BumpAlloc(alloca);
    int* ptr2 = BumpAlloc(alloca);

    *ptr1 = 42;
    *ptr2 = 13;

    return *ptr1;
}
```

Which produces:

```
push    rsi
push    rdi
push    rbx
sub     rsp, 544
lea     rcx, [rsp + 36]
movabs  rax, offset memset
mov     r8d, 508
xor     edx, edx
call    rax
mov     dword ptr [rsp + 32], 1
movabs  rbx, offset "BumpAlloc(int* alloca)"
lea     rsi, [rsp + 32]
mov     rcx, rsi
call    rbx
mov     rdi, rax
mov     rcx, rsi
call    rbx
mov     dword ptr [rdi], 42
mov     dword ptr [rax], 13
mov     eax, 42
add     rsp, 544
pop     rbx
pop     rdi
pop     rsi
ret
```

And notice that the compiler doesn't reload `ptr2` but simply moves 42 into the return register.

`[return: NoAlias]` should only ever be used on functions that are **100% guaranteed to produce a unique pointer**, like with the bump-allocating example above, or with things like `malloc`. It is also important to note that the compiler aggressively inlines functions for performance considerations, and so small functions like the above will likely be inlined into their parents and produce the same result without the attribute (which is why we had to force no-inlining on the called function).

### Function Cloning for Better Aliasing Deduction

For function calls where Burst knows about the aliasing between parameters to the function, Burst can infer the aliasing and propagate this onto the called function to allow for greater optimization opportunities. Lets look at an example:

```c#
[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)]
int Bar(ref int a, ref int b)
{
    a = 42;
    b = 13;
    return a;
}

int Foo()
{
    var a = 53;
    var b = -2;

    return Bar(ref a, ref b);
}
```

Previously the code for `Bar` would be:

```
mov     dword ptr [rcx], 42
mov     dword ptr [rdx], 13
mov     eax, dword ptr [rcx]
ret
```

This is because within the `Bar` function, the compiler did not know the aliasing of `a` and `b`. This is in line with what other compiler technologies will do with this code snippet.

Burst is smarter than this though, and through a process of function cloning Burst will create a copy of `Bar` where the aliasing properties of `a` and `b` are known not to alias, and replace the original call to `Bar` with a call to the copy. This results in the following assembly:

```
mov     dword ptr [rcx], 42
mov     dword ptr [rdx], 13
mov     eax, 42
ret
```

Which as we can see doesn't perform the second load from `a`.

### Aliasing Checks

Since aliasing is so key to the compilers ability to optimize for performance, we've added some aliasing intrinsics:

- `Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing.ExpectAliased` expects that the two pointers **do** alias, and generates a compiler error if not.
- `Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing.ExpectNotAliased` expects that the two pointers **do not** alias, and generates a compiler error if not.

An example:

```c#
using static Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing;

[BurstCompile]
private struct CopyJob : IJob
{
    [ReadOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> Input;

    [WriteOnly]
    public NativeArray<float> Output;

    public unsafe void Execute()
    {
        // NativeContainer attributed structs (like NativeArray) cannot alias with each other in a job struct!
        ExpectNotAliased(Input.getUnsafePtr(), Output.getUnsafePtr());

        // NativeContainer structs cannot appear in other NativeContainer structs.
        ExpectNotAliased(in Input, in Output);
        ExpectNotAliased(in Input, Input.getUnsafePtr());
        ExpectNotAliased(in Input, Output.getUnsafePtr());
        ExpectNotAliased(in Output, Input.getUnsafePtr());
        ExpectNotAliased(in Output, Output.getUnsafePtr());

        // But things definitely alias with themselves!
        ExpectAliased(in Input, in Input);
        ExpectAliased(Input.getUnsafePtr(), Input.getUnsafePtr());
        ExpectAliased(in Output, in Output);
        ExpectAliased(Output.getUnsafePtr(), Output.getUnsafePtr());
    }
}
```

## Compiler Options

When compiling a job, you can change the behavior of the compiler:

- Using a different accuracy for the math functions (sin, cos...)
- Allowing the compiler to re-arrange the floating point calculations by relaxing the order of the math computations.
- Forcing a synchronous compilation of the Job (only for the Editor/JIT case)
- Using internal compiler options (not yet detailed)

These flags can be set through the `[BurstCompile]` attribute, for example `[BurstCompile(FloatPrecision.Med, FloatMode.Fast)]`

### FloatPrecision

The accuracy is defined by the following enumeration:

``` c#
    public enum FloatPrecision
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Use the default target floating point precision - <see cref="FloatPrecision.Medium"/>.
        /// </summary>
        Standard = 0,
        /// <summary>
        /// Compute with an accuracy of 1 ULP - highly accurate, but increased runtime as a result, should not be required for most purposes.
        /// </summary>
        High = 1,
        /// <summary>
        /// Compute with an accuracy of 3.5 ULP - considered acceptable accuracy for most tasks.
        /// </summary>
        Medium = 2,
        /// <summary>
        /// Compute with an accuracy lower than or equal to <see cref="FloatPrecision.Medium"/>, with some range restrictions (defined per function).
        /// </summary>
        Low = 3,
    }
```

Currently, the implementation is only providing the following accuracy:

- `FloatPrecision.Standard` is equivalent to `FloatPrecision.Medium` providing an accuracy of 3.5 ULP. This is the **default value**.
- `FloatPrecision.High` provides an accuracy of 1.0 ULP.
- `FloatPrecision.Medium` provides an accuracy of 3.5 ULP.
- `FloatPrecision.Low` has an accuracy defined per function, and functions may specify a restricted range of valid inputs.

Using the `FloatPrecision.Standard` accuracy should be largely enough for most games.

An ULP (unit in the last place or unit of least precision) is the spacing between floating-point numbers, i.e., the value the least significant digit represents if it is 1.

Note: The `FloatPrecision` Enum was named `Accuracy` in early versions of the Burst API.

#### FloatPrecision.Low

The following table describes the precision and range restrictions for using the `FloatPrecision.Low` mode. Any function **not** described in the table will inherit the ULP requirement from `FloatPrecision.Medium`.

<br/>
<table>
  <tr><th>Function</th><th>Precision</th><th>Range</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.sin(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.cos(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.exp(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.exp2(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.exp10(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.log(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.log2(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.log10(x)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td></td></tr>
  <tr><td>Unity.Mathematics.math.pow(x, y)</td><td>350.0 ULP</td><td>Negative `x` to the power of a fractional `y` are not supported.</td></tr>
</table>

### Compiler floating point math mode

The compiler floating point math mode is defined by the following enumeration:

```c#
    /// <summary>
    /// Represents the floating point optimization mode for compilation.
    /// </summary>
    public enum FloatMode
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Use the default target floating point mode - <see cref="FloatMode.Strict"/>.
        /// </summary>
        Default = 0,
        /// <summary>
        /// No floating point optimizations are performed.
        /// </summary>
        Strict = 1,
        /// <summary>
        /// Reserved for future.
        /// </summary>
        Deterministic = 2,
        /// <summary>
        /// Allows algebraically equivalent optimizations (which can alter the results of calculations), it implies :
        /// <para/> optimizations can assume results and arguments contain no NaNs or +/- Infinity and treat sign of zero as insignificant.
        /// <para/> optimizations can use reciprocals - 1/x * y  , instead of  y/x.
        /// <para/> optimizations can use fused instructions, e.g. madd.
        /// </summary>
        Fast = 3,
    }
```

- `FloatMode.Default` is defaulting to `FloatMode.Strict`
- `FloatMode.Strict`: The compiler is not performing any re-arrangement of the calculation and will be careful at respecting special floating point values (denormals, NaN...). This is the **default value**.
- `FloatMode.Fast`: The compiler can perform instructions re-arrangement and/or using dedicated/less precise hardware SIMD instructions.
- `FloatMode.Deterministic`: Reserved for future, when Burst will provide support for deterministic mode

Typically, some hardware can support Multiply and Add (e.g mad `a * b + c`) into a single instruction. Using the Fast calculation can allow these optimizations.
The reordering of these instructions can lead to a lower accuracy.

Using the `FloatMode.Fast` compiler floating point math mode can be used for many scenarios where the exact order of the calculation and the uniform handling of NaN values are not strictly required.

### Assume Intrinsics

Being able to tell the compiler that an integer lies within a certain range can open up optimization opportunities. The `AssumeRange` attribute allows users to tell the compiler that a given scalar-integer lies within a certain constrained range:

```c#
[return:AssumeRange(0u, 13u)]
static uint WithConstrainedRange([AssumeRange(0, 26)] int x)
{
    return (uint)x / 2u;
}
```

The above code makes two promises to the compiler:

- That the variable `x` is in the closed-interval range `[0..26]`, or more plainly that `x >= 0 && x <= 26`.
- That the return value from `WithConstrainedRange` is in the closed-interval range `[0..13]`, or more plainly that `x >= 0 && x <= 13`.

These assumptions are fed into the optimizer and allow for better codegen as a result. There are some restrictions:

- You can **only** place these on scalar-integer (signed or unsigned) types.
- The type of the range arguments **must match** the type being attributed.

We've also added in some deductions for the `.Length` property of `NativeArray` and `NativeSlice` to tell the optimizer that these always return non-negative integers.

```c#
static bool IsLengthNegative(NativeArray<float> na)
{
    // The compiler will always replace this with the constant false!
    return na.Length < 0;
}
```

Lets assume you have your own container:

```c#
struct MyContainer
{
    public int Length;
    
    // Some other data...
}
```

And you wanted to tell Burst that `Length` was always a positive integer. You would do that like so:

```c#
struct MyContainer
{
    private int _length;

    [return: AssumeRange(0, int.MaxValue)]
    private int LengthGetter()
    {
        return _length;
    }

    public int Length
    {
        get => LengthGetter();
        set => _length = value;
    }

    // Some other data...
}
```

## `Unity.Mathematics`

The `Unity.Mathematics` provides vector types (`float4`, `float3`...) that are directly mapped to hardware SIMD registers.

Also, many functions from the `math` type are also mapped directly to hardware SIMD instructions.

> Note that currently, for an optimal usage of this library, it is recommended to use SIMD 4 wide types (`float4`, `int4`, `bool4`...)

# Standalone Player support

The Burst compiler supports standalone players - see [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements)

## Usage

With the exception of iOS, when burst compiles code for the standalone player, it will create a single dynamic library and place it into the standard plugins folder for that particular player type. e.g. on Windows, it is in the path `Data/Plugins/lib_burst_generated.dll`<br/>
This library is loaded by the Job system runtime the first time a burst compiled method is invoked.

For iOS, static libraries are generated instead, due to requirements for submitting to Test Flight.

Prior to Unity 2019.1, the settings for AOT compilation are shared with the [Jobs Menu](#jobs-burst-menu).<br/>
In later Unity versions (2019.1 and beyond), the settings for AOT compilation are configured via [Burst AOT Settings](#burst-aot-settings).

## Burst AOT Settings

When a project uses AOT compilation, you can control Burst behavior using the **Burst AOT** Settings section of the **Project Settings** window. The AOT settings override the Burst settings on the **Jobs** menu when you make a standalone build of your project.

![Burst AOT Settings](images/burst_aot_settings.png)

- **Target Platform**: Shows the current desktop platform - can be changed via the Unity Build Settings.. dialog.
- **Enable Burst Compilation**: Turns Burst entirely on/off for the currently selected platform.
- **Enable Optimizations**: Turns Burst optimizations on/off.
- **Enable Safety Checks**: Turns Burst safety checks on/off.
- **Use Platform SDK Linker**: Disables cross compilation support (Only applicable to Windows/macOS/Linux standalone players) (see [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements)).
- **Min Target 32Bit CPU Architecture**: Allows you to specify the minimum cpu architecture supported for 32 bit builds (shown when supported).
- **Max Target 32Bit CPU Architecture**: Allows you to specify the maximum cpu architecture supported for 32 bit builds (shown when supported).
- **Min Target 64Bit CPU Architecture**: Allows you to specify the minimum CPU architecture supported for 64-bit builds (shown when supported).
- **Max Target 64Bit CPU Architecture**: Allows you to specify the maximum CPU architecture supported for 64-bit builds (shown when supported).

CPU Architecture is currently only supported for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Burst will generate a standalone player that supports CPU features between the minimum and maximum, inclusive. A special dispatch is generated into the module, so that the code generated will detect the CPU features and select the appropriate architecture level at runtime.

You can set the Burst AOT settings as required for each of the supported platforms. The options are saved per platform as part of the project settings.

**Note:** The Burst AOT Settings are available in Unity 2019.1+.

## Burst AOT Requirements

### Desktop platforms with cross compilation enabled (the default behaviour)

Burst compilation for desktop platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows) no longer requires external toolchain support when building a standalone player (since Burst 1.3.0-preview.1). This should work out of the box, but can be disabled in [Burst AOT Settings](#burst-aot-settings) if needed.

### Other platforms and desktops when cross compilation is disabled

If compiling for a non desktop platform, or you have disabled cross compilation support, then burst compilation requires specific platform compilation tools (similar to IL2CPP), the below table can be used to determine the current level of support for AOT compilation.
- If a host/target combination is not listed, it is at present not supported for burst compilation.
- If a target is not valid (missing tools/unsupported), burst compilation will not be used (may fail), but the target will still be built without burst optimisations.

**Notes:**

- Burst by default now supports cross compilation between desktop platforms (macOS/Linux/Windows)
- The UWP build will always compile all four targets (x86, x64, ARMv7 and ARMv8).

# Known issues

- The maximum target CPU is currently hardcoded per platform (e.g `X64_SSE4` for Windows 64 bits), see the table above.
- Building iOS player from Windows will not use Burst, (see [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements))
- Building Android player from Linux will not use Burst, (see [Burst AOT Requirements](#burst-aot-requirements))
- Mathematical functions for `double2`, `double3`, `double4` are currently not optimized and using the slower scalar version
- `DllImport` is not available on 32bit platforms and on ARM platforms
- For all `DllImport` and internal calls, only primitive types (including pointers) are supported. Passing a struct by value is not supported, you need to pass it through a pointer/reference.
- If you update to a newer version of Burst via the Package Manager in your project which has loaded already Burst, you need to close the editor, remove your library folder and restart the editor
- Function pointers are not working in playmode tests before 2019.3. The feature will be backported.
- Struct with explicit layout can generate non optimal native code
- `BurstCompiler.SetExecutionMode` does not affect the runtime yet for deterministic mode
- Burst does not support scheduling generic Jobs through generic methods. While this would work in the editor, it will not work in the standalone player.

Some of these issues may be resolved in a future release of Burst.
